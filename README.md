## Description

The main focus of this work is port the lwIP library to nanvix and create programs to use the internet protocol like clusters, APIs and web apps.

## What Is Nanvix?

> This repository hosts a fork of educational version of Nanvix.

Nanvix is a Unix-like operating system written by [Pedro Henrique
Penna](https://github.com/ppenna) for educational purposes. It is designed to be
simple and small, but also modern and fully featured.

## What Is lwIP?

lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite created by Adam Dunkels <adam@sics.se> and
Leon Woestenberg <leon.woestenberg@gmx.net>.

The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce the RAM usage
while still having a full scale TCP. This making lwIP suitable for use
in embedded systems with tens of kilobytes of free RAM and room for
around 40 kilobytes of code ROM.

lwIP was originally developed by Adam Dunkels at the Computer and Networks
Architectures (CNA) lab at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS)
and is now developed and maintained by a worldwide network of developers.

## What Hardware Is Required?

Nanvix targets 32-bit x86-based PCs and only requires a floppy or
CD-ROM drive and 16 MB of RAM. You can run it either in a real PC
or in a virtual machine, using a system image.
